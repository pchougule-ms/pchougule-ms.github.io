<h3 align="center"> Auto Insurance Claims Exploratory Data Analysis using Python </h3>

<p align="justify"> As a part of this project, I took an opportunity to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. I used the car insurance claims dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/srinivasankh/insurance-claims-dataset). With this project, I tried to understand the factors to identify the drivers involved in accidents – the correlation of these factors in terms of accident susceptible drivers and the respective claim amounts for the accidents involved.</p>

<p align="justify">Exploratory Data Analysis showed that some of the variables like Age (certain age groups ranging between 26 years to 50 years), certain auto makes like (Dodge, Ford), Certain auto model (E400, Escape), certain occupations (machine op-inspectors, transport-moving high likelihood and handlers-cleaners as low likelihood) have statistically significant correlation with Total claim amount field. The other variables explored like Insured Gender, Insured Relationship did not hold much statistical significance. Also the analysis based on home state vs. accident state indicated that drivers driving more frequently in other states (not in home / policy state) could be susceptible to accidents possibly due to unknown driving conditions.</p>

<p align="justify">This project served as a great opportunity to learn about the Data Preparation / Data Wrangling and Analytics activities as a part of the Data Science project life cycle. The techniques like Discovering / Understanding the data, Web-scrapping, Cleaning and Enriching, Subsetting / Structuring / Formatting, Validating and Visualizing aspects.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project, I looked at the various statistics in terms of COVID-19 cases world-wide as well within USA and different states. Additionally, performed analysis of the vaccine supplies to various states with USA in comparison with the case counts. This helped understand that the impact of COVID-19 cases was one of the major driving factors in distributing the vaccine supplies appropriately to the states.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project, I followed CRISP-DM method to execute the end to end Data Science project, involving Credit Card Lead Predictions. This involved Business Understanding, Data understanding and gathering, Data Wrangling and Preparation, Machine Learning Modeling and Evaluation and Finally the working system to prepare the final predictions with desired accuracy.

<p align="justify">A Private Bank offers variety of products like Checking / Savings accounts, investment products, credit products etc. The bank intends to cross-sell products to its existing customer base via different channels like emails, telephone calls, recommendations on online banking interfaces like mobile apps etc. As a part of current business opportunity, bank plans on identifying the potential customers from the list of eligible customers. </p>

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/pchougule-ms/pchougule-ms/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Portfolio/Current%20Day%20Weather%20Forecast">Current Day Weather Forecast </a></h3>

<p align="justify">This project was the opportunity to create a Python based user interactive application to present the Current Days weather forecast for the users based on the zip code or the location in the form of City / City, State / City, State, Country. This was the very interesting opportunity when initially starting the journey in the field of Data Science.</p>

<p align="justify">It involved taking the learnings of Python and various aspects, like technical approach of building the solution, interacting with APIs from external sites to retrieve the required information, formatting the response and handling the potentially unexpected situations to make it a seamless user experience.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/pchougule-ms/pchougule-ms/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Portfolio/Housing%20Prices%20EDA"> Housing Prices Exploratory Data Analysis using R </a></h3>

<p align="justify">With the in-demand housing market and increasing prices, Real estate / Housing prices topic had gotten my interest. Along with external financial market conditions in a country, various factors contribute to the sale prices of houses / residential properties like size of property, living area, the localities / neighborhood, age of property, number of rooms, building quality to name a few.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project work, I aimed to perform an in-depth Exploration Data Analysis (EDA) using R and to build a possible model to be able to predict the prices based on various factors and get as much closer as possible in terms of predictive power. This model, in turn, would help the customers in determining what would be the fair price to pay for a given house and plan their finances and help save money with close to accurate price predictions.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/pchougule-ms/pchougule-ms/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Portfolio/Sales%20Predictions"> Sales Forecast </a></h3>

<p align="justify">Global Superstore company offers and sells variety of products throughout the year. They need to keep up with the customer demands in terms of the quality and quantity of the products. At the same time, optimal amount of inventory needs to be maintained to keep up with all the delivery timelines. It also needs to be maintain adequate staff to serve all the customer needs, both in store and online demands. Hence, in order to fulfil the customer needs, it would be ideal to predict / know what the demand forecast looks like. This can be achieved by accurately predicting the Sales estimates for the products in near future, which in turn can help determine the optimal levels of product inventory to be maintained.</p>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project, we are looking to help the global superstore with the US sales forecast for the upcoming / rolling 10 days, based on the sales data available for the years 2015 – 2018 based on Order dates. This will help them keep up with the customer demands, appropriate level of inventory maintenance, manage appropriate number of support staff and be prepared with the delivery arrangements.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/pchougule-ms/pchougule-ms/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Portfolio/Telecom%20Company%20Customer%20Churn%20Predictions"> Telecom Company Customer Churn Predictions </a></h3>

<p align="justify">As a part of this project, I followed CRISP-DM method to execute the end to end Data Science project, involving Telecom Customer Churn Predictions. This involved Business Understanding, Data understanding and gathering, Data Wrangling and Preparation, Machine Learning Modeling and Evaluation and Finally the working system to prepare the final predictions with desired accuracy.</p>

<p align="justify">Telecom companies offer many interesting plans for different customers and invest lot of money to attract new customers in the way of special plans and advertisements. After onboarding the new customers, it is very important to retain them for a longer duration of time. The telecom company is concerned about customers leaving the company’s services, which means all the campaigning efforts and new enrollment offer spent to attract customers would be in vain. So, to overcome this issue and minimize the impact of customer churn, it would help to identify and proactively reach out to the company’s customers who would possibly churn in a given month. This helps in retaining business and in turn potentially growing customer base for future, with Happy customers refer their friends and families to the company.</p>
